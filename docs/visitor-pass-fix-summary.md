# Visitor Pass System Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The visitor pass system had several critical issues:
1. Visitor passes could be used multiple times even when intended for single use
2. After a visitor claimed their pass code, the bot would not remember them and ask for authentication again
3. Visitors had access to resident features they shouldn't be able to use

## Changes Implemented (Updated: All Passes Single-Use)

### LATEST UPDATE: All visitor passes are now SINGLE-USE ONLY
- Every visitor pass can only be used once, regardless of type or duration
- After first use, the pass is immediately marked as 'used' and cannot be reused
- Clear messaging throughout the system about single-use nature

## Previous Changes

### 1. Auth Service Enhancements (`src/services/auth.service.ts`)
- Added `VisitorSession` interface to track visitor sessions
- Modified `isAuthenticated()` to check for visitor sessions first
- Added methods for managing visitor sessions:
  - `createVisitorSession()` - Creates a visitor session after successful pass validation
  - `isVisitor()` - Checks if a user is a visitor
  - `getVisitorSession()` - Retrieves visitor session data
  - `clearVisitorSession()` - Ends a visitor session

### 2. Visitor Pass Handler Updates (`src/handlers/visitor-pass.handler.ts`)
- **Single-Use Pass Implementation:**
  - Now checks if pass has already been used before allowing check-in
  - Updates `used_count` and `last_used_at` fields when a pass is used
  - Marks single-use passes as "used" status after first use
  - Prevents reuse of single-use passes (especially for delivery)

- **Visitor Session Creation:**
  - Creates a visitor session upon successful pass validation
  - Stores visitor information for the duration of their visit
  - Shows visitor-specific menu after check-in

- **Access Control:**
  - Prevents visitors from creating new visitor passes
  - Prevents visitors from viewing pass lists (resident-only feature)

### 3. Main Handler Updates (`src/index.ts`)
- Added visitor session awareness to message routing
- Created visitor-specific handlers:
  - `sendVisitorMenu()` - Shows limited menu for visitors
  - `handleVisitorPayload()` - Handles visitor-specific actions
- Visitor menu options:
  - Building Info (limited)
  - Get Directions
  - Contact Info
  - Exit (ends visitor session)

### 4. Visitor Experience Flow

#### Check-In Process:
1. Visitor selects "I'm a Visitor" when prompted
2. Enters their visitor pass code (e.g., VP-XXXX)
3. System validates the pass:
   - Checks if pass exists
   - Checks if pass is single-use and already used
   - Checks if pass is within valid time window
   - Checks if pass status is active
4. If valid, system:
   - Updates pass usage count
   - Marks single-use passes as "used"
   - Creates a visitor session
   - Shows welcome message with visit details
   - Displays visitor-specific menu

#### During Visit:
- Visitor sees limited menu options
- Cannot access resident features (maintenance, bookings, pass creation)
- Gets clear messaging about their visitor status
- Can exit to end their session

#### Single-Use Pass Behavior:
- Delivery passes are automatically single-use
- After first use, pass status changes to "used"
- Attempting to reuse shows error: "This visitor pass has already been used"
- Clear message indicates it was a single-use pass

## Security Features
- Visitor sessions are temporary and expire with the pass validity
- Visitors cannot access any resident features
- Single-use passes cannot be reused
- Clear distinction between visitor and resident access levels

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Visitor can check in with valid pass code
- [x] Single-use pass works only once
- [x] Visitor session persists during conversation
- [x] Visitor cannot create new passes
- [x] Visitor cannot view pass lists
- [x] Visitor menu shows limited options
- [x] Expired passes are rejected
- [x] Used single-use passes show appropriate error

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Log visitor check-ins to a separate table for security auditing
2. Send notifications to residents when their visitors check in
3. Add visitor photo capture for enhanced security
4. Implement visitor pre-registration with QR codes
5. Add visitor analytics dashboard for building management
