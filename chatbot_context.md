Core Chatbot Framework
This chatbot is designed for efficiency and clarity. Every interaction is initiated by the user selecting an option from a persistent menu or a set of contextual buttons. This button-driven approach ensures data is always clean and the user journey is predictable and simple.
User Guidance (The Primary Interface): The chatbot's main function is to guide users through tasks. The conversation always starts with a clear welcome message and a main menu of options presented as buttons (e.g., "🔧 Report Issue," "📅 Book Amenity," "ℹ️ Building Info"). Every step of a process is a clear choice from a list of options.
Human Handoff: At any point in a process, a "Talk to Manager" or "Need More Help?" button is available. Selecting this option will pause the automated flow and notify a human property manager to take over the conversation directly within Messenger.

Detailed Chatbot Features
1. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How it Works in the Chatbot: This feature acts as a digital, interactive version of a building's information sheet. Instead of typing a question, the user navigates a series of menus to find the information they need.
Detailed User Flow:
User selects "ℹ️ Building Info" or "FAQs" from the main menu.
The chatbot presents a list of categories as buttons: "🕒 Hours of Operation," "📜 Policies," "🗑️ Waste & Recycling," "🔑 Access & Keys."
If the user selects "🕒 Hours of Operation," the bot responds with a new set of buttons: "🏊 Pool," "🏋️ Gym," "🏢 Office."
Selecting "🏊 Pool" provides an instant, pre-written text response: "The pool is open from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM, Tuesday to Sunday. It is closed on Mondays for cleaning."
2. Maintenance Request Automation
How it Works in the Chatbot: The chatbot acts as a structured intake form, guiding the user through a series of questions with pre-defined answers to accurately log a maintenance issue.
Detailed User Flow:
User selects "🔧 Report Issue" from the main menu.
The bot responds with "What is the category of the issue?" and provides quick reply buttons: "Plumbing," "Electrical," "Appliance," "General."
The user receives a ticket number and subsequent notifications (e.g., "Technician Assigned," "Request Completed") as automated messages.
3. Integrated Amenity Booking System
How it Works in the Chatbot: This feature functions as a step-by-step booking wizard, presenting available amenities and time slots for the user to select.
Detailed User Flow:
User selects "📅 Book Amenity" from the main menu.
The chatbot displays a carousel of available amenities (images with "Rooftop Grill," "Conference Room," "Guest Suite" as titles). The user taps "Book Now" on their choice.
The bot asks, "Please select a date," and can present the next 7 days as quick reply buttons.
After a date is chosen, the bot responds with available time slots as a list of buttons: "09:00 AM - 11:00 AM," "12:00 PM - 02:00 PM," etc.
The bot presents a summary: "You have selected the 'Rooftop Grill' for Saturday, Sept 13, from 12:00 PM to 02:00 PM. Please confirm your booking."
After confirmation, the user receives a confirmation message. They can view their bookings via a "My Bookings" button in the main menu, which provides options to "Cancel Booking."
4. Visitor Access & Delivery Management
How it Works in the Chatbot: The chatbot serves as a notification center for guest arrivals and package deliveries and a simple tool to pre-register guests.
Detailed User Flow:
Guest Registration:
User selects "👤 Visitor Management" from the menu.
The bot presents buttons: "Register a Guest," "View My Guests."
The user provides the guest's name and expected arrival date/time through a guided conversation.
Notifications (Push Messages):
Guest Arrival: The chatbot sends an automated message: "🔔 GUEST ALERT: Your guest, John Smith, has arrived."
Package Delivery: The chatbot sends a message: "📦 PACKAGE ALERT: A package has been delivered for you. It is located in Locker #12. Use code 5566 to open."
5. Real-Time Security Alerts & Incident Reporting
How it Works in the Chatbot: This is a dual-purpose tool. For residents, it's a structured, discreet way to report issues. For management, it's a broadcast channel for urgent messages.
Detailed User Flow:
Incident Reporting:
User selects "🚨 Report Incident" from the main menu.
The bot asks, "What type of incident?" with buttons: "Security Concern," "Safety Hazard," "Noise Complaint."
The bot then asks for a brief description and prompts the user to upload a photo.
A final button asks, "Report Anonymously?" offering "Yes" or "No" options before submission.
Broadcast Alerts (Push Messages from Management):
Management can push a pre-formatted, high-priority message to all residents, which appears directly in their Messenger chat: "‼️ BUILDING ALERT: The fire alarm has been activated. This is not a drill. Please evacuate immediately."
