# RLS Authentication Fix Summary

## The Problem

The original `fix-auth-rls-final.sql` script was failing with these errors:
```
ERROR: 42703: column "phone_number" of relation "profiles" does not exist
ERROR: 22P02: invalid input value for enum invite_status: "completed"
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Schema Mismatch**: The `user_profiles` table in `schema.sql` has a column named `phone` (line 108), but the migration script was looking for `phone_number`.

2. **Inconsistent Column Names**: The script was trying to migrate data from `user_profiles.phone_number` to `profiles.phone_number`, but the source table uses `phone`, not `phone_number`.

3. **Invalid Enum Value**: The script tried to use `'completed'` as a valid `invite_status` value, but the enum only allows: `'pending'`, `'claimed'`, `'expired'`, `'revoked'`.

4. **Missing Column Creation**: The script attempted to create the `phone_number` column conditionally, but the migration logic ran before this column was guaranteed to exist.

## The Solution

Created `fix-auth-rls-final-corrected.sql` which:

1. **Properly detects column names**: Checks for both `phone` and `phone_number` columns in the source table
2. **Handles mapping correctly**: Maps `user_profiles.phone` ‚Üí `profiles.phone_number` 
3. **Creates table structure first**: Ensures `profiles` table has the correct structure before migration
4. **Includes comprehensive policy cleanup**: Removes all existing policies to prevent conflicts
5. **Uses correct enum values**: Only uses valid `invite_status` values in policy constraints
6. **Adds robust error handling**: Includes notices and checks for better debugging
7. **Provides verification steps**: Shows table structure and record counts after completion

## Key Fixes

### Column Mapping
```sql
-- Old (incorrect):
up.phone_number  -- This column didn't exist in user_profiles

-- New (correct):
up.phone  -- Maps user_profiles.phone to profiles.phone_number
```

### Data Migration Logic
```sql
IF has_phone_number_column THEN
    -- Use phone_number if it exists
    INSERT INTO ... SELECT ..., up.phone_number, ...
ELSIF has_phone_column THEN
    -- Map phone to phone_number
    INSERT INTO ... SELECT ..., up.phone, ...  
ELSE
    -- Insert without phone data
    INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... (no phone column)
```

### Enum Value Fix
```sql
-- Old (incorrect):
WITH CHECK (status IN ('claimed', 'expired', 'revoked', 'pending', 'completed'))

-- New (correct):
WITH CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'claimed', 'expired', 'revoked'))
```

### Role Mapping
Also fixed the role mapping from `user_profiles.role` to `profiles.is_manager`:
```sql
COALESCE(up.role = 'admin', false) as is_manager
```

## Usage

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**
2. **Run `fix-auth-rls-final-corrected.sql`** (the final corrected version)
3. **Check the output** for notices and verification results
4. **Test authentication** with invite code `TEST2024`

## Verification

The script includes several verification steps:
- Shows column structures before migration
- Displays policies created
- Lists available test invites  
- Shows record counts for all tables
- Confirms final table structure

## Files

- ‚úÖ `fix-auth-rls-final-corrected.sql` - **Use this final corrected version**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `fix-auth-rls-corrected.sql` - Fixed phone column issue but still had enum problem
- ‚ùå `fix-auth-rls-final.sql` - Original version with both bugs

## Test After Fix

After running the final corrected script, test the chatbot authentication:
1. Send a message to your Facebook Messenger bot
2. Use invite code `TEST2024` when prompted
3. Verify the authentication flow completes successfully
